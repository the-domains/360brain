            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Tensorflow - Neural Network Playground</h1><p>It's a technique for building a computer program that learns from data. It is based very loosely on how we think the human brain works. First, a collection of software "neurons" are created and connected together, allowing them to send messages to each other.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/b13620a0eb90ee4f5268ed94fae3bc1b4d634178.png"></article>]]></description>
