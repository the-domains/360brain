            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Inside the Epic Go Tournament Where Google's AI Came to Life</h1><p>Edward C. Monaghan Aja Huang dips his hand into a wooden bowl of polished black stones and, without looking, thumbs one between his middle and index finger. Peering through wire-rim glasses, he places the black stone on the board, in a mostly empty zone, just below and to the left of a single white stone.</p><img src="https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/b9381592-404a-40ab-a739-acf090aa051c.jpg"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Deep Learning Paints Videos in Style of Art Masters | NVIDIA Blog</h1><p>Thanks to Instagram and Snapchat, adding filters to images and videos is pretty straight forward. But what if you could repaint your smartphone videos in the style of van Gogh's "Starry Night" or Munch's "The Scream"? A team of researchers from Germany's University of Freiburg has made significant strides toward this goal using an approach to artificial intelligence called deep learning.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/c2458465625de8b80c8dda2517b1351e8b837072.jpg"></article>]]></description>

Technology has always triggered fears of mass unemployment. In 1811 it was the Luddites, who assumed they were done for.
