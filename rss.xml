            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Inside the Epic Go Tournament Where Google's AI Came to Life</h1><p>Edward C. Monaghan Aja Huang dips his hand into a wooden bowl of polished black stones and, without looking, thumbs one between his middle and index finger. Peering through wire-rim glasses, he places the black stone on the board, in a mostly empty zone, just below and to the left of a single white stone.</p><img src="https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/b9381592-404a-40ab-a739-acf090aa051c.jpg"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Deep Learning Paints Videos in Style of Art Masters | NVIDIA Blog</h1><p>Thanks to Instagram and Snapchat, adding filters to images and videos is pretty straight forward. But what if you could repaint your smartphone videos in the style of van Gogh's "Starry Night" or Munch's "The Scream"? A team of researchers from Germany's University of Freiburg has made significant strides toward this goal using an approach to artificial intelligence called deep learning.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/c2458465625de8b80c8dda2517b1351e8b837072.jpg"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Imagine Discovering That Your Teaching Assistant Really Is a Robot</h1><p>One day in January, Eric Wilson dashed off a message to the teaching assistants for an online course at the Georgia Institute of Technology. "I really feel like I missed the mark in giving the correct amount of feedback," he wrote, pleading to revise an assignment. Thirteen minutes later, the TA responded.</p><img src="https://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-NW986_0505ji_H_20160505152220.jpg"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Boosting Performance of Machine Learning Models</h1><p>People often get stuck when they are asked to improve the performance of existing predictive models. What usually they do is try different algorithms and check their results. But often they end up not improving the model. Here are some of the steps you can take to boost your existing models.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/aafdc6ef26036ec19412d23193eacb0561344335.png"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Robots have been about to take all the jobs for more than 200 years - Timeline</h1><p>Is it really different this time? Technology has always triggered fears of mass unemployment. In 1811 it was the Luddites, who assumed they were done for. In the 1930s, it was vaunted economist John Maynard Keynes, who implicated technology as one reason for the unemployment of the Great Depression.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/903a13df9f97cfca2b49c444d0221f69a8e3b5db.png"></article>]]></description>
